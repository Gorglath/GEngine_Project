# GEngine

GEngine is a custom built game engine which uses Ogre3d-Next. <br />

## Usage
Currently GEngine is still a work in progress and is bound to changes. <br />

## Dependencies

GEngine dependencies at the moment are Ogre3d-Next and SDL2, you can get both by downloading the Externals.rar here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/epyoeg5bt0kpzm3/AABGsu-0bW37cMppWALmjULQa?dl=0)

To use the project unpack the externals.rar to the same folder as the solution.
